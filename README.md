# Hooks for Jetpack Compose


A collection small handy, ready-made hooks for Jetpack Compose so that you don't have to think about the states, logic or anything. Just plug it in and use!
Inspired from react hooks.


[`useFetch`](https://github.com/CuriousNikhil/compose-hooks/usefetch) - When you want just to fetch some data and don't want to setup everything unnecessarily!

[`useNetworkState`](https://github.com/CuriousNikhil/compose-hooks/useNetworkState) - When you want to use the network connectivity as a state in Compose!

[`useReducer`](https://github.com/CuriousNikhil/compose-hooks/useReducer) - When you want to make your state updates in Redux style.
